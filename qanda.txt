I have started this document to discuss the GitHub workflow.
If you have a question, add it to the end of the text and commit to a new branch, then send a pull request so that the team can discuss the question. The answer will then be appended to this document in a new line and the brnach merged and deleted.

This is both a way to get general questions answered and to practice the workflow!

Question: Was the tutorial useful?
